# Mayo-Clinic
The Mayo Clinic is an American nonprofit academic medical center currently based in three major locations, Rochester, Minnesota; Jacksonville, Florida; and Scottsdale, Arizona focused on integrated patient care, education, and research. Mayo Clinic holds the number 1 rank among hospitals in the United States.

It was opened on the 30th of September 1889. Over the years it grew in size and facilities. It increased the size of its premises and also the number of doctors it employs. The vast number of patients it treated made management of such a huge hospital an arduous task. The paperwork and storing of all patientsâ€™ records was becoming unmanageable. It was then the management of the hospital decided to invest money in a hospital management software. The Hospital Management System is designed to manage all hospital operations.

The 1980s initiated transformative changes that set the course for the modern Mayo Clinic. As an early adopter of the Internet, Mayo Clinic has been recognized for its online communications to patients.
